# Imperative Programming Workshop: Pointers and Recursion

Are you often forgetting where you left your memory? Or do you keep going into the same function without ever getting out?

Our workshop will help you get the hang of these two difficult topics of the Imperative Programming course.
The workshop will start with a theoretical lecture, to give an in-depth explanation on the topics. After that we will have a hands on workshop where you can practice, discuss and master Pointers and Recursion.
